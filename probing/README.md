# Running the probing experiments

This directory contains the code for running the probing experiments, where the aim is to check how well different vision encoders can distinguish between different images.

You can run the script for all models by running the script (**please modify the file to fit your GPU/cluster configuration**):

```
sbatch run_models.sh
```
